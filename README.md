This repository is a collection of several spatial interpolation algorithm along with various sensor placement algorithms. 


To get started with using the toolkit, kindly install the package by using
```
python setup.py install --user
```

Then one can run the usage*.py modules to get an overview of the algorithms on some example datasets.


For the experiments, results and analysis accompanying our paper, please refer to the results folder.
Inside the results folder, we have three folders: interpolation, placement and appendix.
* interpolation corresponds to results from the interpolation experiment,
* placement corresponds to results from the placement experiment, and
* appendix correponds to additional results not mentioned in our paper.
